This project aims to uncover insights into why customers leave the Teco Telecom service and how business strategies can be aligned to reduce churn.

---

## Short Description

A detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using Python to identify key factors influencing customer churn in a telecom company. It includes visualizations and strategic recommendations to improve customer retention.

---

## Project Objective

To analyze customer churn behavior based on contract types, payment methods, tenure, and demographics using Python and derive actionable business insights.

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 7043 records with features like:

- Demographics (gender, senior citizen, dependents)
- Account details (contract type, tenure, payment method)
- Service usage (internet service, security, streaming)
- Churn indicator

## Key Insights

- **Churn Rate by Contract Type**:
  - Month-to-month: **42%** churn rate
  - One-year: **11%**
  - Two-year: **3%**

- **Churn Rate by Payment Method**:
  - Electronic check: **45%**
  - Credit card/bank transfer/mailed check: **15–18%**

  - Tenure < 1 year: **50%**
  - Tenure > 3 years: **15%**

- **Senior Citizens** churn more (**41%**) compared to younger customers (**26%**)

##  Visualizations

The project includes:

- Count plots for churn vs. features (e.g., contract, payment, tenure)
- Pie chart and bar plots to visualize churn distribution
- Subplots for service features and their churn impact
- Annotated graphs to improve interpretability

---

## Recommendations

- **Promote long-term contracts** with discounts/incentives
- **Discourage electronic check payments** via targeted campaigns
- **Focus on onboarding experience** in the first 3–6 months
- **Create senior citizen loyalty programs** for better retention
